Hi there!

I'm Dan, general tinkerer, and user advocate.

I worked in product for most of my professional career, from Service design and Innovation in a big corporate French company to Head of Applications at a fast-growing infrastructure monitoring company in Berlin.

This is my space to jot down thoughts I have around tech and what I've seen. Plus, updates on my projects and learnings. For anything feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spaccapeli/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dspaccapeli)!
