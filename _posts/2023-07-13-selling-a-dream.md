As a trained engineer and a lover of organized, beautiful content, I used to think that substance was what counted. Building something good with your skill set and understanding what needs to be built - that's what you needed to do. And sure, there is also something beautiful about creating something with inherent properties that make everything go smoothly. Or maybe that’s just my romantic idea of it.

But as I grow and gain more experience, I have come to realize that appearances often trump substance. I see it everywhere, from startups to professional life. Being noisy, being visible, being political - these are the things that seem to matter more than what you do and how you do it. Almost like that’s what is rewarded. At least in the short or medium terms.

It seems to be that it is not just about successfully doing something - it's about how much other people see it. How much are people aware of what you're doing? You have to constantly show it off, speak about yourself, and sell a dream. And when it comes to startups and raising funds from investors, appearances become even more crucial.

Your ability to sell a dream about where you'll be in the future, how beautiful everything will look, and how smoothly everything will run becomes the priority. You craft your slide deck, prepare your story, and rehearse your pitch to woo investors with your fancy words and slides. You try to be inspirational, even when the reality is far from the truth.

It’s understandable why you would want to do it. Whether to an investor or your colleagues. You want them to appear decisive, that's what you do, their money is what matters. And it must be exhausting. Constantly be enamored by your words. So much that you end up believing them yourself.

But is this the best approach? Is it worth being potentially disingenuous?

I believe that being vulnerable and honest about the challenges and risks, while displaying confidence in your ability to tackle them, is a better approach. Being practical and grounded in reality, yet still painting a rosy picture of the future, can set you apart from those who sell a dream without addressing the realities.

And what I often see is not focusing on that. In my experience, I see an overwhelming majority of people focusing on appearance. It seems like we are bombarded with influencers and celebrities who are constantly good, always smiling, and falsely optimistic. Is it any wonder that we have become more obsessed with appearances than substance?

Selling yourself should be a rarity, but it seems like we are bombarded with influencers and celebrities who are constantly good, always smiling, and falsely optimistic. Is it any wonder that we have become more obsessed with appearances than substance?

It's time to get back to reality and realism, acknowledging the challenges and having honest conversations about them. Let's not just sell dreams and optimism - let's work towards progress while being aware of the challenges we are facing. Let's not hide the risk, but face them head-on.

Let's not fall into the trap of appearances over substance. Let's strive to be true to ourselves and sell ourselves authentically, grounded in reality. We are falling in love with the wrong side of politicking. We are focusing on aesthetics. It may not appeal to everyone I realize. But I want to bet that this is the way.

Don’t sell a dream. Work hard, do a good job, and be modest. Avoid showing off and bet that you are going to be rewarded for it in the long run.
