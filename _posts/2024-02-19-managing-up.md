Leading a team is only a fraction of a manager's responsibilities. When I became a manager, my world revolved around my product and my team. I was constantly thinking about the needs of our users. Delivering on promises and creating value for customers with the resources available were my primary concerns.

Over time, however, I realized that managing isn't just about customer focus. It's equally about nurturing your team's growth and satisfaction. It's a hefty role; the team isn't your only concern however. Sometimes, it's crucial to focus 'upwards'â€”towards your manager. This perspective can greatly benefit you and your team.

Your manager doesn't just oversee your team; they're an enabler, shielding you and supporting your team's growth. They're the key to giving your team autonomy. Everyone craves creativity and freedom to make decisions in their work, especially in knowledge-based fields. We want to be more than just cogs in a big machine.

A good manager's confidence in their team's abilities can increase their autonomy. I believe autonomy is an important professional goal that deserves its own discussion.

These are the four takeaways to keep in mind when starting out as a new manager:

1. Set clear expectations: Understand the benchmarks for you and your team. Without clarity, you're navigating blindly. Knowing what you're being measured against helps you focus your efforts and build a track record, which in return builds trust.

2. Minimize their workload: Strive to make your team self-sufficient. You should be on a steady upward trajectory, meeting agreed-upon metrics. Always be prepared, understand your needs, options and trade-offs. This shows not only control, but respect for your manager's time.

3. Showcase team contributions: Remember that you're part of a team, not a lone wolf. Transparency is key. Acknowledging individual strengths and weaknesses can highlight areas where your manager's guidance can be invaluable.

4. Be open about challenges: It's not all positive. Acknowledge when things aren't great. Addressing problems is the first step to solving them. But balance is key - be a realistic optimist.

Remember that leading a team is only part of your role. Looking in all directions, especially upwards, can bring significant benefits. And never overlook one of the most important "users" of your team: your manager.
